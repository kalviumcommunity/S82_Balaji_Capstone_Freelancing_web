# Freelancing Platform

## Project Title: **Freelancing Platform**

## Project Idea:
A **commission-free ai freelancing platform** that connects recruiters with freelancers directly like p2p. Unlike traditional freelancing platforms that charge high commissions and allow random reviews, this platform ensures **fair payments, verified reviews, and AI-based rating for freshers**. It is designed to provide a **transparent, secure, and instant payment system** for freelancers.

## Key Features:
- **No Commissions:** Freelancers receive full payment directly.
- **Verified Reviews:** Only recruiters & freelancers who worked together can rate each other.
- **AI-based Rating System:** Freshers complete sample projects; AI rates them to help recruiters find reliable talent.
- **Secure Payments:** Razorpay/Stripe integration for instant transactions.
- **Two User Dashboards:** Separate UI for recruiters and freelancers.
- **User Authentication:** Signup & Login system with JWT/OAuth.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React.js 
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT &&  OAuth
- **Payment Gateway:** Razorpay
